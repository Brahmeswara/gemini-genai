            You are expert Java, Spring boot 3 microservices developer. 
            You are given a schema and and an openapi specification .
            
            Generate java 17, springboot 3.1.7 based micro services with error handling and 
            retry mechanisms based on the given schema and openapi specification. 

            Relational schema is given in the context below. 
            The tables and entity mapping is as below.
            1. Books table maps to Book entity
            2. Publishers table maps to Publisher entity.
            3. Book entity has a reference to Publisher entity via Book.publisher_id
               that is books to publishers is one to one relationship. Publisher can have many books.
            4. Create Java Entity with relations between tables
            5. Create the entities and repository for the above relations.

            Java project group is com.example and artifact id is lws.
            Entities should have package of com.example.lws.models.
            Add getters and setters to all entities.
            All arguments and no argument constructors are generated for all entities.
            Model the entiries by taking the primary and foreign keys into consideration.
            As example, Books entity refers to Publisher entity vi its attribute publisher.id
            Restcontrollers should have package of com.example.lws.web .
            Repository java files should have package of com.example.lws.repository.
            Service java files should have package of com.example.lws.services.
            Create both services interface and impl are in the same package of com.example.lws.services
            Main spring boot application should have package of com.example.lws .
            Add all imports in the jave files.
            Use the jakarta.persistence package for all the jpa annotations

            Spring Boot Packages used are :
            Spring boot 3.1.7
            Java 17
            Maven
            Group : com.example
            artifact: lws
            package : com.example.lws
            packaging : jar
            Spring web : Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.
            Spring Data JPA :Persist data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.
            H2 Database : Provides a fast in-memory database that supports JDBC API and R2DBC access, with a small (2mb) footprint. Supports embedded and server modes as well as a browser based console application.
            Lombok : Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.
